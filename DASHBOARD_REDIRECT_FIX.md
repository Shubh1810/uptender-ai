# 🔧 Dashboard Redirect Fix

## Problem
After signing in with Google from `tenderpost.org`, you're being redirected to the homepage `/` instead of the dashboard `/dashboard`.

---

## ✅ Complete Solution

### **Step 1: Add Wildcard URLs in Supabase**

You currently have:
- ✅ `https://tenderpost.org/auth/callback`
- ✅ `https://tenderpost.org/dashboard`

**You MUST ADD these wildcards:**

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → URL Configuration
2. Click "Add URL" and add:
   ```
   https://tenderpost.org/**
   ```
3. Click "Add URL" again and add:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/**
   ```

Your final list should be:
```
✓ https://tenderpost.org/auth/callback
✓ https://tenderpost.org/dashboard
✓ https://tenderpost.org/**          ← ADD THIS
✓ http://localhost:3000/**           ← ADD THIS

Total URLs: 4
```

### **Step 2: Verify Site URL is HTTPS**

Make sure Site URL is:
```
https://tenderpost.org
```
(NOT `http://tenderpost.org`)

### **Step 3: Save Changes**

Click "Save changes" at the bottom of the page.

## 🔍 What I Fixed in the Code

I improved the dashboard to:
1. **Retry checking for session** up to 3 times with exponential backoff (500ms, 1s, 1.5s)
2. **Add console logs** so you can see what's happening in DevTools
3. **Handle auth state changes** better
4. **Prevent redirect during loading** if session is still being established

### Console Logs You'll See:

**Success:**
```
✅ User found in session: your@email.com
```

**Retry:**
```
⏳ Retry 1/3: Waiting for session...
⏳ Retry 2/3: Waiting for session...
✅ User found in session: your@email.com
```

**Failure:**
```
⏳ Retry 1/3: Waiting for session...
⏳ Retry 2/3: Waiting for session...
⏳ Retry 3/3: Waiting for session...
❌ No session found after retries
(redirects to homepage)
```

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### **1. Deploy the Code Changes**

```bash
cd /Users/shubh/Desktop/1-Projects/TenderHub/tenderhub
git add .
git commit -m "Fix dashboard redirect issue"
git push origin main
```

Wait for Vercel to deploy (~2 minutes).

### **2. Test in Production**

1. Open **Incognito/Private window** (important!)
2. Go to: `https://tenderpost.org`
3. Open **DevTools** (F12) → **Console** tab
4. Click "Sign in with Google"
5. Complete OAuth flow
6. Watch the console logs
7. Should redirect to: `https://tenderpost.org/dashboard` ✅

### **3. Check the Logs**

You should see:
```
Signing in with redirect URL: https://tenderpost.org/auth/callback
[After OAuth completes]
⏳ Retry 1/3: Waiting for session...
✅ User found in session: your@email.com
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Still Redirects to Homepage?**

**Check these in order:**

1. **Console Logs:**
   - Open DevTools → Console
   - Look for the emoji logs I added
   - If you see "❌ No session found after retries", the issue is cookies not being set

2. **Check Cookies:**
   - DevTools → Application → Cookies → `https://tenderpost.org`
   - Look for cookies starting with `sb-`
   - If missing, the issue is Supabase cookies not being set

3. **Check Supabase Wildcard URLs:**
   - Must have `https://tenderpost.org/**` (with `**`)
   - Not just `https://tenderpost.org/dashboard`

4. **Check Site URL:**
   - Must be `https://tenderpost.org` (with `https`)
   - Not `http://tenderpost.org`

5. **Check Environment Variables in Vercel:**
   - Go to Vercel → Settings → Environment Variables
   - Make sure `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are set for **Production**

6. **Clear Build Cache:**
   - Vercel → Deployments → Redeploy
   - Uncheck "Use existing Build Cache"

- [ ] Supabase Site URL = `https://tenderpost.org` (https!)
- [ ] Supabase Redirect URLs includes `https://tenderpost.org/**` (wildcard!)
- [ ] Supabase Redirect URLs includes `http://localhost:3000/**` (for dev)
- [ ] Code changes pushed to GitHub
- [ ] Vercel deployment completed
- [ ] Testing in Incognito/Private window
- [ ] DevTools Console open to see logs

## 🎯 Expected Flow

```
1. User on tenderpost.org
   ↓
2. Clicks "Sign in with Google"
   Console: "Signing in with redirect URL: https://tenderpost.org/auth/callback"
   ↓
3. Google OAuth screen
   ↓
4. User authorizes
   ↓
5. Redirect to: https://tenderpost.org/auth/callback?code=xxx
   ↓
6. Callback exchanges code for session
   ↓
7. Redirect to: https://tenderpost.org/dashboard
   ↓
8. Dashboard loads
   Console: "⏳ Retry 1/3: Waiting for session..."
   ↓
9. Session found
   Console: "✅ User found in session: user@email.com"
   ↓
10. Dashboard displays with user info ✅
```

## 🆘 If Still Not Working

1. Check **Network tab** in DevTools:
   - Look for `auth/v1/token` request
   - Check if it returns 200 OK
   - Check response has `access_token` and `refresh_token`

2. Check **Supabase Logs**:
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard → Logs → Auth logs
   - Look for authentication events
   - Check for errors

3. **Try manually navigating** to dashboard:
   - Sign in
   - If redirected to homepage, manually go to: `https://tenderpost.org/dashboard`
   - If dashboard loads, the issue is the redirect
   - If dashboard redirects you back to homepage, the issue is the session

4. **Check if cookies are being blocked:**
   - Some browsers block third-party cookies
   - Try in different browser
   - Check browser settings

## ✨ What Changed

### **Before:**
- Dashboard checked for session once
- If no session after 500ms → redirect to homepage
- No retries, no logs

### **After:**
- Dashboard retries 3 times (500ms, 1s, 1.5s)
- Console logs show what's happening
- Better auth state change handling
- Gives more time for cookies to settle

**This should fix the dashboard redirect issue!** 🎉

The combination of:
1. ✅ Wildcard redirect URLs in Supabase
2. ✅ Retry logic in dashboard
3. ✅ Better session checking

Should ensure users land on the dashboard after signing in.
